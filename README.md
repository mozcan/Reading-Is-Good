# Reading-Is-Good


First of all , I designed database part . I defined tables and relations . After that, I created a new Spring Boot application. Before start to project business , I developed table Entities and relations. I used H2 database engine. After that , I started to write tests and business logic. I tried to be careful to the error handling and log processes. I used Postman for RestAPI tests.
